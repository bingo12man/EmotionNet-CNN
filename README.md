# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Description
This project focuses on **Sentiment Analysis**, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that classifies text data into different sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, and neutral. The model utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze sentiments from various text sources, including social media, customer reviews, and news articles.

The goal of this project is to develop an **efficient sentiment classifier** that can process text input, extract features, and predict sentiment with high accuracy. The implementation includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), and BERT embeddings.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest.
- **Deep Learning Models**: LSTMs, CNNs, and Transformer-based models like BERT.
- **Visualization**: Sentiment distribution, word clouds, and confusion matrices.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Predict sentiment from live social media feeds or user input.
