# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Description
This project implements **Sentiment Analysis** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Google News Word2Vec embeddings**. The model classifies text into **positive or negative sentiments** based on the provided dataset.

The pipeline includes **text preprocessing, word embedding generation using pre-trained Google News Word2Vec, CNN-based feature extraction, and classification**. CNNs help in capturing local and hierarchical text representations, improving sentiment prediction accuracy.

## Features
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization.
  - Word sequence padding for uniform input length.

- **Word Embeddings**:
  - Uses **pre-trained Google News Word2Vec embeddings** to improve word representations.
  - Converts text into vectorized form for deep learning models.

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:
  - **1D convolutional layers** extract relevant sentiment patterns.
  - **Global Max Pooling** for dimensionality reduction.
  - **Dense layers** for final sentiment classification.

- **Training & Evaluation**:
  - Uses **train-test split** for evaluation.
  - Implements `ModelCheckpoint` to save the best-performing model.
